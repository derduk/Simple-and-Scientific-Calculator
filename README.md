React Calculator Project

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project: a React Calculator that combines functionality with a modern, responsive design. This calculator supports both basic and scientific operations, making it versatile for everyday and advanced use.

Key Features

Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark modes for a tailored user experience.


Scientific Mode: Handles advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and square roots using mathjs.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Keyboard Support: Full keyboard input for enhanced accessibility.

Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs and displays clear error messages.

Tech Stack

React: Leveraged useState and useEffect for state management and keyboard event handling.

CSS: Styled with a mobile-first approach, including media queries for all screen sizes.

mathjs: Powers complex mathematical evaluations.

CSS Animations: Gradient transitions and hover effects for a polished UI.

Why This Project?

This was an opportunity to refine my skills in React, focus on clean code, and create a visually appealing, functional tool. The glassmorphism design and smooth animations were fun to implement, and ensuring cross-device compatibility was a rewarding challenge.

Try it out, explore the code, or share your thoughts! Iâ€™d love to hear about your recent projects or discuss UI/UX and React development. Connect with me to talk tech! ðŸš€
